He started his PhD program in the ABM-Lab in September 2015. His main research interests include the use of mathematical, computational, and statistical modelling to analyze epidemiological dynamics of communicable diseases and evaluate the economic and budget impact of health intervention measures, including vaccination programs. His research bridges the disciplines of mathematics and biology and has broad applications in real life with significant socioeconomic benefits and cross-disciplinary collaboration, including informing policymakers on the best course of action and expected outcomes of health interventions.</p><h3 id=list-of-publications>List of publications</h3><p>Coming soon&mldr;</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
